- Some real-world examples of supervised learning in research


## What is supervised learning?

Supervised learning is one of the most widely used types of machine learning in the field of AI. Supervised models make predictions about their inputs. They learn how to make those predictions from a dataset of examples that are labelled with the correct prediction (also called the _ground truth_).

Our job in using supervised learning is to define what the input and output of a model should be, to obtain the labelled data, and then to train the model to make accurate predictions.

One example of supervised learning is that of predicting whether an email is spam or not. In this example, there are two _categories_, or _classes_ - SPAM and NOT_SPAM.

Our machine learning models cannot directly accept email text as input, so first we extract numerical features from each of the emails. Three features might be, for example, the length of the email, the number of spelling mistakes, and the number of dollar signs in the email.

By training the model directly on a dataset of emails that have been labelled as being spam or not, the model can learn the patterns that identify the two types of email, and then predict for a new email whether it is spam or not. 

## Classification and Regression

Supervised learning can either be **classification** or **regression**.

**Classification** is where the output is one of a fixed number of categories. This could be a binary classification task where there are exactly two possible outputs, like the example above of spam email detection.  You can think of the model as finding a line to separate the two classes, as here:

Usually, there's some overlap between our classes, but we can find a good way to separate them. Usually though, classifiers find a way to separate two classes that is more complex than just a straight line. 

A different task might have multiple categories that an input could belong to. For example, recognising the face of a person in a photo. There are many possible people who could be pictured in the photo, and each person is a possible category.


![Multi-class Classification](imgs/sup4.png){ align=center }

In other scenarios, an input might have more than one label. For example, a photo might have two or more different people in it, and we'd like to identify each. This is called _multi-label_ classification, because each photo has more than one label associated with it.

Sometimes the number of classes can be very large, in the thousands or millions, as in the case of many language processing tasks. Automatically translating text from one language to another is a supervised task, where the model predictions are words in the target language. 

**Regression** is similar to classification, except that the output is a continuous number rather than a discrete class. Examples might be predicting the toxicity of a molecule on a scale. Fitting a line of best fit is a simple kind of regression.

## Feature Extraction

It's worth noting that machine learning models require numerical inputs, and you'll need to consider in designing your setup. Some tasks naturally have numerical inputs already - whether that's data from sensors, medical tests, pixel values or some other kind of data that's naturally a number. In other tasks, like in text processing, we need to convert our input to a numerical format by extracting _features_.


## Examples of Supervised Learning

Examples of supervised learning tasks include:

| Task | Input | Prediction |
| ---- | ----- | ------ |
| Segment tumours in medical images | Medical images | Areas which are tumours |
| Toxicity prediction | Chemical formula | Toxicity |
| Medical Diagnosis | Biomarkers, test results etc. | Diagnosis |
| Automated transcription | Audio files | Written transcription |
| Machine translation | Text in the source language | Text in the target language |


## Types of Supervised Learning Model

Some of the common supervised learning algorithms you might encounter are:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees 
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks

Much of the recent excitement around AI focuses on neural network approaches. However, depending on your data and task, the other algorithms may be more practical to use.


## Top Tips for getting started

1. A great place to begin is by thinking about the task you want to used supervised learning for. Can you define your task as a supervised learning one? What are the inputs and predictions of your model?
2. Next, think about the data you have. Can you label it easily?
3. Evaluating your model is also important, and at this point it's feasible to think about how you'll evaluate whether your system is working. What metrics could you use?
4. What are the risks and concerns with your proposed work?

Once you've answered these questions, you're ready to move onto training a model.
