# Reinforcement Learning


## Learning Objectives

This section will help you understand:

- What reinforcement learning is, and where you can use it
- Some real-world examples of reinforcement learning in research



## Overview
Reinforcement learning is an area of AI and ML looking at tasks where the computer has to take a series of moves in an uncertain and changing environment, to achieve a goal. 

RL is used in scenarios like

- Playing computer games (DeepMind’s Go and Atari models)
- Human-computer dialogue
- Controlling robots in dynamic environments

In each of these tasks, it’s hard to judge in isolation whether a single turn or move by the computer is optimal, but we do know in the long-term whether the computer achieves its goal. The machine may or may not have good visibility of its environment. 

Reinforcement learning aims to optimise a reward that the machine gets from successfully completing its goal, perhaps with some penalty for taking too long. 

An agent, i.e. the computer, exists in an environment. The agent must take a series of actions, moving them between states. Over time, they accumulate a reward. 

Compared to supervised and unsupervised methods, RL learns dynamically. 

In real-world scenarios is might not be feasible (or timely) for the machine to learn in the real environment, so it may be simulated. 

Much theoretical work has been done in a computer game environment where the reward is the score at the end of the game. 

RL algorithms learn a policy - that’s the model to decide which action to take in any one state.
