# Reinforcement Learning


## Learning Objectives

This section will help you understand:

- What reinforcement learning is, and where you can use it
- Some real-world examples of reinforcement learning in research



## Overview
Reinforcement learning is an area of AI and ML looking at tasks where the computer has to take a series of moves in an uncertain and changing environment, to achieve a particular goal. 

RL is used in scenarios like

- Playing games
- Human-computer dialogue
- Controlling robots in real-world environments

In each of these tasks, itâ€™s hard to judge in isolation whether a single turn or move by the computer is optimal. Yet, we do know in the long-term whether the computer achieves its goal.
