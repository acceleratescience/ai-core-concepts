# Reinforcement Learning


## Learning Objectives

This section will help you understand:

- What reinforcement learning is, and where you can use it
- Some real-world examples of reinforcement learning in research



## Overview
Reinforcement learning is an area of AI and ML looking at tasks where the computer has to take a series of moves in an uncertain and changing environment, to achieve a particular goal.

Reinforcement Learning models learn through trial and error, and are given a _reward_ signal if they achieve their goal. The models aim to optimise their reward. In practice, it's used much less than supervised and unsupervised learning. 


## Reinforcement Learning Use Cases
RL is used in scenarios like:

- Playing games, where the computer can choose to make optimal moves but there is some uncertainty about the moves its opponent may make. 
- Human-computer dialogue, where again the computer can choose an optimal utterance, but there is uncertainty about what the person will say and how that affects the trajectory of the conversation. 
- Controlling robots in real-world environments where there is uncertainty about how the environment changes over time.

In each of these tasks, itâ€™s hard to judge in isolation whether a single turn or move by the computer is optimal. Yet, we do know in the long-term whether the computer achieves its goal.
