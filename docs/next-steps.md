# Next Steps


## Learning Objectives
This section will help you understand:

- How to get started learning more about AI
- What help and support is available

## Resources

Now you have an idea how and where AI is used, and hopefully can identify some places in your research where you can see the potential for concrete application of AI.

Next places to look:

- Our Resource hub contains links to more in depth lessons and tutorials
- Our workshops on LLMs and Diffusion models
- Software Engineering help
- AI Cafe and Clinic sessions

## Where else can I look?

We recommend this textbook:

[**Hands-on machine learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow : concepts, tools, and techniques to build intelligent systems / Aurélien Géron.**](https://idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=44CAM_ALMA51626615430003606&context=L&vid=44CAM_PROD&lang=en_US&search_scope=SCOP_CAM_ALL&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=cam_lib_coll&query=any%2Ccontains%2CHands%20On%C2%A0Machine%20Learning%C2%A0with%C2%A0ScikitLearn%2C%C2%A0Keras%2C%C2%A0and%20TensorFlow&sortby=rank&facet=frbrgroupid%2Cinclude%2C200454433&offset=0)

This book has code and exercises that illustrate many of the concepts in this course.
