# Next Steps


## Learning Objectives
This section will help you understand:

- How to get started learning more about AI
- What help and support is available

## Resources

Now you have an idea how and where AI is used, and hopefully can identify some places in your research where you see the potential for concrete applications of AI.

Accelerate Science provides resources to support you in your next steps:

- Our [Resource hub](https://acceleratescience.github.io/resource-hub/) contains links to more in depth lessons and tutorials
- We run several workshops, including on Generative AI topics of LLMs and Diffusion models
- We provide AI & Software Engineering help to researchers via our AI Clinic, where you can file a ticket to receive 1-1 help
- We run regular drop-in AI Cafe sessions where you can turn up and talk with an expert

## What more is there to learn?
If you do decide to go further and really understand the theory of AI, you’ll need to dig into these topics:

- Maths - the theory of machine learning relies on some core maths knowledge, including linear algebra, optimisation, probability and calculus. To understand the theory of AI and ML, and if you want to work on designing your own models and algorithms, you’ll need to learn this maths.
- Programming - there are some AI tools you can use without any particular expertise (e.g. ChatGPT), but if you want to do anything more complicated with AI then you’ll likely need to know some programming. Python is the language of choice for many ML Scientists, though R is also used in some domains.
- Data Literacy - AI and ML is all about working with datasets - collecting, cleaning, processing, visualising, aggregating & exploring data. Intuition about data is often built up over time, working with different algorithms, tasks, and datasets.

## Where else can I look?

There are many free resources online to learn about AI. We also recommend this textbook:

[**Hands-on machine learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow : concepts, tools, and techniques to build intelligent systems / Aurélien Géron.**](https://idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=44CAM_ALMA51626615430003606&context=L&vid=44CAM_PROD&lang=en_US&search_scope=SCOP_CAM_ALL&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=cam_lib_coll&query=any%2Ccontains%2CHands%20On%C2%A0Machine%20Learning%C2%A0with%C2%A0ScikitLearn%2C%C2%A0Keras%2C%C2%A0and%20TensorFlow&sortby=rank&facet=frbrgroupid%2Cinclude%2C200454433&offset=0)

This book has code and exercises that illustrate many of the concepts presented in this course.
