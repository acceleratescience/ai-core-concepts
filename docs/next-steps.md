# Next Steps


## Learning Objectives
This section will help you understand:

- What help and support is available
- Recommended textbooks

## Accelerate Science Resources

Now you have an idea how and where AI is used, and hopefully can identify some places in your research where you see the potential for concrete applications of AI.

Accelerate Science provides resources to support you in your next steps:

- Our [Resource hub](https://docs.science.ai.cam.ac.uk/resource-hub/) contains links to more in depth lessons and tutorials
We run several day-long workshops, including on the Generative AI topics of [LLMs](https://docs.science.ai.cam.ac.uk/large-language-models/) and [Diffusion models](https://docs.science.ai.cam.ac.uk/diffusion-models/)
- We provide AI & Software Engineering help to researchers via our AI Clinic, where you can file a ticket to receive one-to-one help
- We run regular drop-in AI Cafe sessions where you can turn up and talk with an expert - look out for the next one, or get in touch to organise with us
- Our introduction to Python Programming course will support you as you get started with learning python
- We run courses on [publishing and packaging software](https://docs.science.ai.cam.ac.uk/packaging-publishing/) and Docker, to help you with the software practicalities of running AI projects


## Where else can I look?

There are many free resources online to learn about AI. We also recommend this textbook for those looking for code examples of some of the concepts discussed so far:

[Hands-on machine learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow : concepts, tools, and techniques to build intelligent systems / Aurélien Géron.](https://idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=44CAM_ALMA51626615430003606&context=L&vid=44CAM_PROD&lang=en_US&search_scope=SCOP_CAM_ALL&adaptor=Local%20Search%20Engine&isFrbr=true&tab=cam_lib_coll&query=any,contains,Hands%20On%C2%A0Machine%20Learning%C2%A0with%C2%A0ScikitLearn,%C2%A0Keras,%C2%A0and%20TensorFlow&sortby=rank&facet=frbrgroupid,include,200454433&offset=0)

A second textbook is this one, which dives deeper into some of the ideas presented here:

[Deep Learning: Foundations and Concepts / Chris Bishop & Hugh Bishop](https://www.bishopbook.com/)
