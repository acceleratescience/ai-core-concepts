# Some Practical Advice


## Learning Objectives
This section will help you understand:

- Popular tools for getting started
- Managing experimentation
- Ways to share your work

## Programming

If you choose to continue and use AI in your research, you will likely need to learn some programming. Even if you don't intend to train your own models, but simply use what's already been built, you may find that programming is helpful to speed up your work.

Most AI and ML work is done in Python. In some fields, R is used as an alternative. Python has great support for machine learning. There are many libraries available to use, such as Pytorch and HuggingFace.

Many researchers begin exploring ML code using Notebooks such as Jupyter or Google Colab. These can be a great way to get started exploring, but you might find that once you've made some good progress your code becomes unwieldy and you look for other ways to structure your work. 

Managing the code for your project is best done using a version control tool like GitHub. A tool like this will allow you to track the changes you make to your code, go back and forth between versions, and easily collaborate with colleagues. 


## Good Experimental Practice

Once you've got started with programming, the next challenge is usually managing your experiments and tracking work. It can be easy to rapidly create lots of files and find your files hard to navigate. 

For recording your work, [Model Cards](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993) and [Data Sheets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010) provide a structured way to log what you've built so that others can understand. 

## Sharing your work

At the end of your project, sharing your model, data and code with the open source community can be done. Openness is key to scientific rigour. 

Accelerate Science have a course on packaging software, which you can sign up to, or follow the materials online at your own pace.
