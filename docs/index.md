# Welcome to Accelerate Science's Core AI Concepts

**Machine learning has become an indispensable tool for researchers across disciplines.**

In response, Accelerate Science’s programme offers tailored support to help those who would like to learn more about AI. 

AI and data-driven techniques have the potential to revolutionise research across scientific disciplines. AI is being used across the entire scientific research lifecycle - speeding up literature review, enhancing data analysis, accelerating experimentation, generating research hypotheses, simulating physical equations, and directly modelling physical phenomena. Researchers across fields are looking to learn more about AI and understand how they can apply it in their own work.

The field of AI has its roots in Maths and Computer Science. Many courses in AI assume familiarity with these subjects and present AI from a theoretical mathematical standpoint. They are often aimed at researchers who want to do fundamental AI research. For researchers from across disciplines who are more interested in applied AI research, or who are examining the impact of AI in the world, this theoretical perspective is not the ideal starting point to learn about AI.

This short online course is a set of resources to explain the core concepts behind AI. It’s not a full introduction to the theory and practice of AI, but a starting point for researchers. The first part of this course will dive into some of these concepts and build up an intuition about how AI and ML systems work, without relying on you having any specific maths and programming background knowledge. This will help you understand how and where AI and ML might be useful in your research, demystify some of the field's vocabulary, and give you the basis to dig further. The second part of the course talks about some of the practicalities and process of building AI systems. This can help you interpret research papers in AI, and to get a sense of the work involved if you choose to implement AI in your work. This online course covers the core concepts of AI for researchers who are at the beginning of exploring AI in their work. It's designed as an introduction to the core concepts behind AI, demystifying some of the field's vocabulary, helping researchers to understand how they might use AI in their own work, and signposting ways to get started.
