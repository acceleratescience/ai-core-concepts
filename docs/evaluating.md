# Evaluating AI Models


## Learning Objectives
This section will help you understand:

- Quantative vs qualitative evaluation
- Robust use of data for evaluation
- Evaluation metrics
- Error analysis tools including confusion matrices & ROC

## Data split
Split your data into train/test/dev splits
If you have a small set, something like k-fold cross validation is the best bet.
