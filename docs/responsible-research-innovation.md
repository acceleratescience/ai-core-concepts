# Responsible Research and Innovation


## Learning Objectives
This section will help you understand:

- Some of the limitations of AI models
- The wider risks of AI
- Regulation that might apply

## AI model limitations

When using AI, it's important to know about

**Hallucinations** are the name given to a specific 

**Accuracy** models aren't 100% accurate

**Appropriateness** some tasks just aren't appropriate for AI

**Black-box** nature of many models

## Risks and Concerns

**Bias**

**Environment**

**Accountability** and human oversight

**Reproducibility**

**Source of data** copyright, consent etc.

**Potential for misuse**

**Explainability and Transparency**

## Regulation

Regulation for AI is being developed, and is a shifting area, so always do your own research into regulations that might apply.

The first AI law to pass is the EU's AI act. This regulation has some banned uses of AI, along with some high-risk applications that come with obligations if they are deployed. Most of the act doesn't apply to research, but could come into force if you move to commercialise your work.
