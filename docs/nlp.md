- What falls under the umbrella of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Some common NLP tasks

## What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the umbrella term for techniques that involve processing text data. NLP is a large domain, and there are lots of opportunities to use NLP across a wide range of subjects. Hence, it can be useful for researchers to know some of the ways NLP is used.

The field of NLP has been transformed by machine learning in the past couple of decades. Supervised learning techniques were applied across a range of text processing tasks. Recently, the NLP field has moved in the direction of using foundation models and generative AI.

## NLP Tasks

If you want to work with text data in your field, the chances are good that you'll want to use some kind of NLP technology. 

Many common NLP tasks exist, which have a long line of research into them, including:

- **Language Modelling** is the task of predicting the next word, like an autocomplete. It's the basis of recent progress in NLP relating to generative AI. 
- **Machine Translation** automatically translates text from a _source_ lanugage to a _target_ language. 
- **Summarisation** is when a model is used to summarise a long piece of text into a shorter one.
- **Question Answering** answering questions where the answer can be found in a text that has been provided. E.g. answering questions from a textbook.
- **Sentiment Analysis** analysing whether a piece of text is positive or negative in its sentiment.
- **Named Entity Recognition** picking out certain key entities from a phrase. For example, picking out names of cities, countries or people from text. 

Many of these tasks have well established benchmark datasets, which researchers use to evaluate the performance of these models in a generic setting. 


## NLP Data

NLP models are typically trained using text data from the internet. This data is often selected to have a broad coverage of general topics. 

Researchers wanting to use NLP techniques in specific domain or field may need text from that domain for their models, to capture the kinds of vocabulary and phrases that are used.
