# Natural Language Processing


## Learning Objectives
This section will help you understand:

- What falls under the umbrella of Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Some of the common NLP tasks

## What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the umbrella term for techniques that involve processing text data. NLP is a large domain, and text processing is commonly used across fields. Hence, it can be useful to know some of the ways NLP is used.

Recently, the NLP field has moved in the direction of using foundation models and generative AI.

## NLP Tasks

If you want to work with text data in your field, the chances are good that you will want to use some kind of NLP technology. 

Many common NLP tasks exist, which have a long line of research into them, including:

- **Lanugage Modelling** is the task of predicting the next word, like an autocomplete. It's the basis of recent progress in NLP relating to generative AI. 
- **Machine Translation** automatically translates text from a _source_ lanugage to a _target_ language. 
- **Summarisation** is when a model is used to summarise a long piece of text into a shorter one
- **Question Answering** answering questions where the answer can be found in a text. E.g. answering questions from a textbook
- **Sentiment Analysis** analysing whether a piece of text is positive or negative in its sentiment
- **Named Entity Recognition** picking out certain key entities from a phrase. For example, picking out names of cities, countries or people from text. 



## NLP Data

Data for NLP is text, and often comes from the internet.
