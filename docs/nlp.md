- Some common NLP tasks
- Examples of NLP applied to scientific research


## What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the umbrella term for techniques that involve processing text data. NLP is a large domain, and there are many opportunities to use NLP across a wide range of scientific disciplines. NLP techniques that are used in one domain are very easily transferred to another with just a change in the data being processed. A technique which works well on legal texts, for example, is likely to work well on medical text data. Or a model that has been trained on general text data can be tuned to work with scientific papers. Hence, if you anticipate processing text data in your research, it can be valuable to look to the NLP literature to understand what has been done in similar domains.

The field of NLP has been transformed by AI and machine learning. Supervised and unsupervised learning techniques have been applied across a range of text processing tasks in many different disciplines. The NLP field has had a key influence in transformer-based foundation models and generative AI.


## NLP Tasks

If you want to work with text data in your field, the chances are good that you'll want to use some kind of NLP technology. Many common NLP tasks exist, which have a long line of research into them, including:


- **Language Modelling** is the task of predicting the next word, like an autocomplete. It's the basis of recent progress in NLP relating to generative AI.
-  **Machine Translation** automatically translates text from a source language to a target language.
-  **Summarisation** is when a model is used to summarise a long piece of text into a shorter one.
-  **Question Answering** answering questions where the answer can be found in a text that has been provided. E.g. answering questions from a given textbook.
-  **Sentiment Analysis** analysing whether a piece of text is positive or negative in its sentiment.
-  **Named Entity Recognition** picking out certain key entities from a phrase. For example, picking out names of molecules, drugs or diseases from text.
-  **Text classification** assigns predefined categories to text documents.
-  **Coreference resolution** identifies which references to people or objects in a text are referring to the same entity, such as when “it” and “the paper” are referring to the same item
-  **Semantic similarity** is identifying whether two pieces of text have similar meanings
-  **Relation extraction** identifies relations between two entities in text, like “Paris is a city” or “the apple is green”.
-  **Word sense disambiguation** identifies which sense, or definition, of a word is being used, e.g. whether “bank” refers to a river bank or the financial institution.

Many of these tasks have well established benchmark datasets, which researchers use to evaluate the performance of these models in different domains.



## Examples of NLP in Scientific Research

NLP models are typically trained using text data from the internet. This data is often selected to have a broad coverage of general topics. Researchers wanting to use NLP techniques in a specific domain or field may need to collect text from that domain for their models, to capture the kinds of vocabulary and phrases that are used.

There are many sources of text data available to researchers. Examples of NLP work on data sources that researchers might be interested in include:

- NLP techniques help researchers search through scientific literature, provide summaries, answer questions about papers and find new papers that are similar to existing papers. 
- Language models can be built using electronic health records, which can then be used for tasks like extracting medical concepts and question answering.
- NLP models monitor changing sentiment about events such as covid-19 from social media data
- NLP can be used to analyse legal texts and policy documents, providing researchers with key points about those policies
