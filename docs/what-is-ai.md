# What is AI?


## Learning Objectives
This section will help you understand:

- What AI is and where it is used
- Some different definitions of AI and related terms


## Overview
AI has grown in popularity over the past decade, and is cropping up in many places. If you're a researcher who wants to use AI in your work, it's helpful to understand what AI is and to think about how you can use it effectively. 

This short online course is a set of resources to explain the core concepts behind AI, without the need for maths and programming. The goal is to allow researchers to explore the ideas behind AI and consider how they might work in research, before diving in to learn more. 

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** doesn’t have a strict definition. Usually it’s thought of as something like imitating human intelligence. AI systems are used to automate decision making in tasks that typically need some level of intelligence to perform. 


**Machine Learning (ML)** is a set of algorithms that learn their behaviour from data. This is in contrast to more traditional computer programming that spells out the rules that a computer must follow. When people talk about AI today, they're mostly talking about machine learning. All of the recent progress in the field of AI has been in machine learning.

There are 4 broad categories of ML that this course will explore:

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Generative AI

## AI in the real-world

In the AI world, we often talk about **tasks**. A task is something specific that a model might do such as:

- Make a decision about whether an email is spam or not
- Identify people in images
- Translate text from one language into another
- Predict whether a transaction on your credit card is fraudulent
- Automatically transcribe your speech
- Play the game of Go with an opponent
- Predict whether an X-ray shows a cancerous mass
- Predict the toxicity of a chemical compound

Tasks usually have **datasets** associated with them, which is essentially lots of examples of that task. For example, a spam email detection dataset would consist of many emails. A speech recognition dataset would consist of audio files of people speaking. 

A dataset might have **labels** (or annotations), which are the **gold standard**, or the correct answer, for each item in the dataset. The emails in your spam email dataset would have labels marking each email as spam or not. The audio files in your speech recognition dataset would have accurate transcriptions of the words spoken. 

Many popular AI tasks have open source datasets that are available to use. Though, depending on the existing research in your field, you might need to go and collect your own dataset. 

An ML **model** is built to perform a task, using one or more datasets. The model is usually the artefact that's the result of your experimentation, and it can be used again and again on new data.

Under the umbrella of ML, there are many different algorithms. Deep Learning, or **Deep Neural Networks**, are popular today because they’ve had big success. There are many other algorithms though, some of which may be more suitable for your data.

In the next sections, we'll dive into these concepts in more depth. 

## What will this course give me?

This course will dive into some of these concepts and build up an intuition about how AI and ML systems work, without relying on you having any specific maths and programming background knowledge. This will help you understand how and where AI and ML might be useful in your research, desmystify some of the field's vocabulary, and give you the basis to dig further. This course is not a full introduction to the theory and practice of AI, but we'll point you to places to learn more.
