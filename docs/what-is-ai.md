# What is AI?


## Learning Objectives
This section will help you understand:

- What AI is and where it is used
- Some different definitions of AI and related terms


## Overview
AI has grown in popularity over the past decade, and is cropping up in many places. If you're a researcher who wants to use AI in your work, it's helpful to understand what AI is and to think about how you can use it effectively. 

This short online course is a set of resources to explain the core concepts behind AI, without the need for maths and programming. The goal is to allow researchers to explore the ideas behind AI and how they might work in research, before diving in to learn more. 

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** doesn’t have a strict definition. Usually it’s thought of as something like imitating human intelligence. AI systems are used to automate decision making in tasks that typically need some level of intelligence to perform. 


**Machine Learning (ML)** is a set of algorithms that learn their behaviour from data. This is in contrast to spelling out the rules that a computer must follow. Most of the recent success in AI has been down to Machine Learning. There are 3 broad categories of ML that this course will explore:

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

Under the umbrella of ML, there are many different algorithms. Deep Learning, or **Deep Neural Networks**, are popular today because they’ve had big success. There are many other algorithms though, some of which may be more suitable for your data.

## AI in the world

In the AI world, we often talk about **tasks**. A task is something specific that a model might do such as:

- Make a decision about whether an email is spam or not
- Identify people in images
- Translate text from one language into another
- Predict whether a transaction on your credit card is fraudulent
- Automatically transcribe your speech
- Play the game of Go with an opponent
- Predict whether an X-ray shows a cancerous mass
- Predict the toxicity of a chemical compound

Tasks usually have **datasets** associated with them, which is essentially lots of examples of the task. For example, a spam email detection dataset would consist of many emails. A speech recognition dataset would consist of audio files of people speaking. 

A dataset might have **labels** (or annotations), which are the **gold standard**, or the correct answer, for each item in the dataset. The emails in your spam email dataset would have labels marking each email as spam or not. The audio files in your speech recognition dataset would have accurate transcriptions of the words spoken. 

Many popular AI tasks have open source datasets that are available to use. Depending on what people have done in your task before, you might need to go and collect your own dataset. 

An ML **model** is built to perform a task, using one or more datasets. The model is usually the artefact that is the result of your experimentation, and it can be used again and again on new data (with some caveats, which we’ll go into further down the line). 

## What will this course give me?

This course will dive into some of these concepts and build up an intuition about how AI and ML systems work, without relying on any specific background knowledge. This will help you understand how and where AI and ML might be useful in your work, and giving you the basis to dig further. 

To take this further, and really understand the theory of AI, you’ll need to dig into these topics, which are beyond the scope of this course:

- Maths - the theory of machine learning relies on some core maths knowledge, including linear algebra, optimisation, probability and calculus. To understand the theory of AI and ML, and if you want to work on your own models and algorithms, you’ll need to learn this maths.
- Programming - there are some tools you can use without any particular expertise (e.g. ChatGPT), but if you want to do anything more complicated with AI then you’ll need to know some programming. Python is the language of choice for many ML Scientists, though R is also used in some domains. Accelerate Science works with Cambridge Spark to provide this education.
- Data Literacy - AI and ML is all about working with datasets - collecting, cleaning, processing, visualising, aggregating & exploring data. This intuition is often built up over time, working with different algorithms, tasks, and datasets.
