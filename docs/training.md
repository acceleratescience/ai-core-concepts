# Training ML Models

## Learning Objectives

This section will help you understand:

- Know what it means to train an AI model
- Backpropagation, the algorithm used for training neural networks
- How to use data for robust training, development and testing
- Over and under fitting
- Tuning hyperparameters
- Know about the iterative approach to building a model


## Data
Split your data into train, test, dev splits.
Really important to ensure no leakage between training and testing.
Shuffling your data


## Backpropagation

## Over and under fitting

## Hyperparameters


## Training supervised models

Training a supervised learning algorithm involves:

1. decide on the task and collect data; label that data
2. train a model on a 'training' set of your data
3. evaluate the model on a separate test set, to see how well it does
4. investigate the errors to see where you can improve

This tends to be an iterative process, not a linear one, so you may need to loop through these steps several times to get a model that works. 

Popular supervised learning algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks.



## Top Tips for getting started


1. Prototype - start with a small model and a simple baseline; Start with a small dataset, before increasing the amount of data
2. Ensure there's no leakage between your test and training data
3. Make use of open source libraries, models and data
