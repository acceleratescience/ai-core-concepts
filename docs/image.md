## What is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision (CV) is the field of AI that's concerned with processing images and video. One of the most popular introductory ML datasets you might come across is [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database), a set of images of handwritten digits.

When we think of images, we usually imagine a photo taken with a camera. However, across the sciences, there are many other sources of image data in use such as X-rays, ultrasound, CT scans, satellite images, electron microscopy etc. The same techniques that are applied to photos are often used in these other image formats. 

A key model for image processing is the _convolutional neural network_ (CNN). These have been used for many years in computer vision. Recently, with the trend for increases in the dataset and model size, CNNs have proven to be very successful in modelling images. More recently, generative AI has made an impact in the field of computer vision. Models like Dall-E and Stable Diffusion are able to generate a wide range of images from a text prompt. These techniques make use of _diffusion models_, a technique that was introduced in 2015.

## CV Tasks

Computer vision is widespread, and many CV tasks exist including:

- **Classification**: classifying an image into one of several categories, e.g. classifying the handwritten digit in the MNIST task.
- **Segmentation**: segmenting an image into different parts. For example, identifying boundaries of objects within an image. In a medical image this could also be something like identifying the boundaries of a tumour. 
- **Image generating**: creating images from text descriptions, as is done by Stable Diffusion and Dall-E. 
- **Denoising and enhancement**: removing noise from images and enhancing them
- **Pose detection**: identifying the pose of the person (or animal) in an image
