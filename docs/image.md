This section will help you understand:

- What Computer Vision (CV) is
- Some of the tasks that fall under CV

## What is Computer Vision?

Computer Vision (CV) is the field of AI that is concerned with processing images and video. 

When we think of images, we typically imaging a photo taken with a camera. However, across the sciences, there are many other sources of image data such as X-rays, ultrasound, CT scans, electron microscopy etc.

A key model for image processing is the _convolutional neural network_ (CNN). These have been used for many years in the field. Recently, with increases in the dataset and model size, CNNs have been very successful in modelling images. 

## CV Tasks

Many CV tasks exist including:

- **Classification**: classifying an image into one of several categories.
- **Segmentation**: segmenting an image into different parts. For example, identifying boundaries of objects within an image. In a medical image this could also be something like identifying the boundaries of a tumour. 
- **Image generating**: creating images from text descriptions
- **Denoising**: removing noise from images
- **Pose detection**: identifying the pose of the person (or animal) in an image
