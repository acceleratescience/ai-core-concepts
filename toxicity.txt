As we get better at predicting new molecules, e.g. as candidates for new drugs, it's important to know if they are toxic or not. This is a complicated task as molecules react differently in different organisms and scenarios.

Two common ways to collect data are via in vitro and in vivo methods, but this data doesn't reliably capture clinical toxicity. Most work is done on a single one of these tasks

(Explainability is also a challenge - the OECS recommends that predictions of computational toxology models be explainable).

This paper has a multi-task setup.

The features are either (i) SMILES embeddings or (ii) Morgan fingerprints, two ways of representing molecules. The first was created using a neural network model to embed the SMILES. 

in vivo, in vitro and clinical toxicities were predicted with multi-task and single-task DNNs. 

The ground truth was whether or not a molecule failed clinical phase trials due to toxicity

Each of these was a categorical classification of 'toxic' or 'not'.

Three datasets: ClinTox, Tox21 and RTECS.

skewed datasets are a problem in toxicology with unbalanced classes.
