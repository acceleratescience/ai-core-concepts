Large in both the size of the dataset they\u2019re built from, and in terms of number of parameters in the model (i.e. how much size they take up on disk &amp; memory they use). </p> <p>Generative AI comes from language modelling. Language modelling is the task of predicting the next word in a sentence. This is technically a supervised learning task, where the task is given a sequence of words, predict the next word. However, it doesn\u2019t require large amounts of effort to label data, because \u201cnext word\u201d is inherently there in the data. This model is a very powerful autocomplete model. </p> <p>Note that there\u2019s also \u201cmasked\u201d LM, which is predicting the missing word in the middle of a sentence, but otherwise the concepts are the same.</p> <p>What\u2019s interesting about Generative AI models is that when trained on large amounts of data, they are able to do several tasks that they weren\u2019t explicitly trained to do. Or, they can be fine-tuned to do a task with a small amount of data - far smaller than the amount of data that\u2019s needed to build a supervised model from scratch. </p> <p>These large \u2018foundation models\u2019 are typically trained once by an organisation with the money and resources to do so, and then used by many others.

A clustering algorithm might group them into clusters that you hope would correspond to specific individuals. This is not unlike the processing that your phone's library might do.
