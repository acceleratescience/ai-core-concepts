Supervised models make predictions about their inputs. They learn how to make those predictions from a dataset of examples that are labelled with the correct prediction (also called the ground truth).</p> <p>Our job in using supervised learning is to define what the input and output of a model should be, to obtain the labelled data, and then to train the model to make accurate predictions. </p> <p></p> <p>One example of supervised learning is that of predicting whether an email is spam or not. In this example, there are two categories, or classes - SPAM and NOT_SPAM.</p> <p>Our machine learning models cannot directly accept email text as input, so first we extract features from each of the emails. Three features might be, for example, the length of the email, the number of spelling mistakes, and the number of dollar signs in the email. </p> <p></p> <p>By training the model directly on a dataset of emails that have been labelled as being spam or not, the model can learn the patterns that identify the two types of email, and then predict for a new email whether it is spam or not. </p>"},{"location":"supervised-learning/#classification-and-regression","title":"Classification and Regression","text":"<p>Supervised learning can either be classification or regression.</p> <p>Classification is where the output is one of a fixed number of categories. This could be a binary classification task where there are exactly two possible outputs, like the example above of spam email detection. A different task might have multiple categories that an input could belong to. For example, recognising the face of a person in a photo. There are many possible people who could be pictured in the photo, and each person is a possible category. </p> <p>In other scenarios, an input might have more than one label. For example, a photo might have two or more different people in it, and we'd like to identify each. This is called multi-label classification.</p> <p>Sometimes the number of classes can be very large, as in the case of many language processing tasks. Automatically translating text from one language to another is a supervised task, where the model predictions are words in the target language. </p> <p>Regression is similar to classification, except that the output is a continuous number rather than a discrete class.
